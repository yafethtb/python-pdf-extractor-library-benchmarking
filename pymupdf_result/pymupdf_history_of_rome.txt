THE GEOGRAPHY OF ITALY

tly, ribbed by the Apennines, girdled by the Alps and th sea,
juts out ikea “long piet-head” fom Europe towards the northern
coast of Africa. It includes two regions of widely differing
physical characteristics: dhe norther, continental: the southern,
peninsulat. The peninsula is slightly larger than the continental
portion: together their reais about 91,200 square miles.

‘Continental Italy. The continental portion of Kaly consist of
the southem watershed ofthe Alps and the northem watershed of|
the Apennines, with the intervening lowland plain, drained, for
the most part, by the river Po and sts numerous tributaries. On
the north, the Alps extend in an irregular crescent of over 1200
mils rom the Mediterranean to the Adriatic They rise abruptly
‘on the Italian side, but their north slope is gradual, with easy
passes leading over the divide to the southern plain. ‘Thus they
invite rather than deter immigration from central Europe. East
and west continental Italy measures around 320 miles; its width
from north o south does not exceed seventy miles

‘The peninsula, ‘The southern portion of Kly consists of a
Jong. narrow peninsula. running northwest and southeastbetween
the Mediterranean and Adriatic sets, and terminating in two
romontories, which form the toe ad el of the “Italian boot
The length ofthe peninsula is 650 miles; its breadth is nowhere

‘more than 125 miles. In striking contrast to the plains of the
Po, southern Italy i traversed throughout by the parallel ridges
of the Apennines, which give it an endless diversity of bill and
valley. The average height of these mountains, which form
a sort of vertebrate system for the peninsula (Apennino dorso
alia dividinur, Livy xxx, 15), is about 4,000 feet, and even
their highest peaks (9,500 feet) are below the line of perpetual
snow. The Apennine chain is highest on its eastern side where
it approaches closely tothe Adriatic, leaving only a narrow strip
of coast land, intersected by numerous short mountain torrents
On the west the mountains are lower and recede further from
the sea, leaving the wide lowland areas of Etruria, Latium and
Campania. On this sie, too, are rivers of considerable length,
navigable for small raf: the Volturnus and Lris, the Tiber and
the Amo, whose valleys link the coast with the highlands of the

‘The coastline, In comparison with Gresce, Italy presents &
striking regularity of coas-line. Throughout its length of over
2000 miles it has remarkably few deep bays or good harbors
land these few are almost all onthe southern and western shores
Thus the characte ofthe Mediterranean cost of Italy, with its
ferile lowlands, its rivers, its harbors, and its general southerly
aspect, rendered it more inviting and accesible o approach from
the sea than the eastern coast, and determined its leadership in
the cultural and material advancement of the peninsula
Climate. The climate of aly as a whole, like that of
other Mediterranean lands, is characterized by high average
temperature, and an absence of extremes of heat or cold
Nevertheless, it varies greatly in different localities, acconding
to their northern or southern situation, their elevation, and their
proximity to the sea. In the Po valley there is a close approach
to the continental climate of central Europe, with a marked
difference between summer and winter temperatures and clearly
‘marked transitional periods of spring and attumn. On the other

hand, in the south of the peninsula the climate becomes more
tropical, with its periods of winter rain and summer drought, and
rapid transition between the moist and the dry seasons.

‘Malaria. Hoth in antiquity and in modern times the disease
from which Kaly has suffered most hasbeen the dreaded malaria
The explanation i to be found in the presence of extensive
‘marshy areas in the river valleys and along the coast. The
ravages of this disease have varied according as the progress
of civilization has brought about the cultivation and drainage of
the affected areas or its decline has wrought the undoing of this
beneficial work.

Forests, In st

ing contrast to their present baldness, the
slopes of the Apennines were once heavily wooded, and the
welll fields of the Po valley were also covered with tll
forests. Timber for houses and ships was to be had in abundance,
and as late as the time of Augustus laly was held 10 be a
well-frested country.

‘Minerals. ‘The mineral wealth of Italy has never been very
reat at anytime. In antiquity the most important deposi were
the iron ores ofthe islandof Elba, and the copper mines of Etruria
and Liguria, Fora time, the gold washings in the valleys of the
Graian Alps were worked with profit

Agriculture. ‘The true wealth of Italy lay i the richness of
her soil, which generously repaid the lor of agriculturist or
hontculturst. The lowland areas yielded large erops of grain of
all sorts—millet, maize, whet, oats and barley—whle legumes
‘were raised in abundance everywhere. Campania was especially
fertile and is reported to have yielded three successive crops
annually. The vine andthe olive Nourished, and ther cultivation
eventually became even moce profitable than the rising of grain

The valleys and mountain sides afforded excellent pastrage
at all seasons, and the raising of cattle and sheep ranked
next in importance to agricultural pursuits among the country’s
industries.

‘The islands: Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica. The geographical
location of the three arg islands, Sicily. Sardinia and Corsica,

inks their history closely with tha of the Halian peninsula, The
large triangle of Sicily (11,290 sq. mi.) is separated from the
southwest extremity of Italy by the narrow straits of Rhegium,
tnd lies like a stepping-stone between Europe and Africa. ts
situation, and the richness ofits soil, which caused itt become
lone of the granaries of Rome, made it of far greater historical
importance than the other two islands. Sardinia (9,400 sq. mi.)
and Corsica (3,376 sq. mi) owing to their rugged, mountainous
character and their greater remoteness from the coast of Hay.
have been always, from both the economic and the cultural
standpoint, far behind the more favored Sicily.

‘The historical significance of Italy's configuration and
location. The configuration of the Halian peninsula, long,
narrow and traversed by mountain ridges, hindered rather than
helped its political unification. Yet the Apeanine chin, running
parallel to the length of the peninsula, offered no such serious
barriers to that unification as did the network of mountains and
the long inlets that intersect the peninsula of Greece. And when
once Italy had been welded into a single state by the power of
Rome, its central position greatly facilitated the extension of the
Roman dominion over the whole Mediterranean basi,

‘The name Italia. The name lta is the ancient aia derived
from the people known as the Fal, whose name had its origin
inthe word viulus (calf). It was applied by the Greeks as early
25 the fiflh century 8. to the southvesten extremity of the
Peninsula, adjacent to the island of Sicily. It rapidly acquired a
‘much wider significance, uni fom the opening ofthe second
century alia ina geographical sense denoted the whole country
3s far nonh as the Alps. Politically as we shal see, the name for
‘long time had a much more restricted significance.

PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION IN
ITALY

Accessibilty of Italy to external influences. The long coast-
line ofthe alan peninsula rendered it peculiarly accessible to
influences from overseas, for the sea united rather than divided
the peoples of antiquity. ‘Thus Italy was constantly subjected
to immigration by sea, and much more so to cultural stimuli
from the lands whose shores bordered the same seas as her own,
[Nor did the Alps andthe forests and swamps of the Po valley
‘oppose any effectual barter to migrations and cultural influences
from central Europe. Consequently we have in Kaly the meeting
_roundlof peoples coming by se fom eas and south and coming
‘over land from the nor, each bringing a new racial, linguistic,
and cultural element t enrich the life ofthe peninsula. These
‘movements had been going on since emote antiquity. uni tthe
beginning of the period of econded history, Italy was occupied
by peoples of diferent races, speaking different languages, and
living under widely different political and cultural conditions.

‘As yet many problems connected with the origin and
migrations of the historic peoples of Italy remain unsolved:
but the sciences of archaeology and philology have done much
‘owanl enabling us to present a reasonably clear and connected
picture ofthe development of civilization and the movements of
these peoples in prehistoric times,

"The Old Stone Age. From all ver Italy come proofs of the
presence of mani the earliest stage of human development—the
Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. ‘The chipped lint instruments of

ia
 8 A History of Rome to $65 A.D.

this epoch have been found in considerable abundance, and are
chiefly of the Moustérien and Chellgen types. With these have
ben unearted the bones ofthe eave Bear cave lion, cave hyens,
lant stag, and arly types ofthe rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and
tlephant which Paleolithic man fought and hunted. In the Balzt
Rossi caves, car Ventimiglia in Liguria there have been found
human skeletons, some of which, atleast, are agreed tobe of the
Paleolithic Age. But the caves in Liguria and elsewhere, then the
only habitations which men knew, donot reveal the lifelike and
vigorous mural drawings and carvings on bone, which the Old
Stone Age has lft inthe caves of France and Spain.

‘The New Stone Age. With the Neolithic or New Stone Age
there appears in Italy a civilization characterized by the use
of instruments of polished stone. Axes, adzes, and chisel, of|
various shapes and sizes, aswell as other wensls, were shaped by
polishing and grinding from sandstone, limestone, ade, nephrite
Aioite, and other stones. Along with these, however, articles of
chipped flint and obsidian, for which the workshops have been
found, and also instruments of bone, were in common use. The
Nenlithic people were also acquainted with the art of making
pottery, an art unknown to the Paleolithic Age.

Like the men of the preceding epoch, those of the Neolithic
Age realy took up their abode in natural caves. However, they
also built for themselves villages of circular hus of wicker-work
and clay, at times erected over pits excavated in the ground,
Such village sites, the so-called fonde di capanne, are widely
distributed throughout Italy

They buried their dead in eaves, or in pits dug in the ground,
sometimes lining the pit with stones. The corpse was regularly
placed ina contracted position, accompanied by weapons, vases
clothing, and food. Second burials and the practice of coloring
the bones ofthe skeletons with red pigment were in vogue.

Climatic change. The climate of Italy had changed
considerably from that ofthe preceding age, and anew fauna had
 appeared. In place ofthe primitive elephant and his associates,
Neolithic men hunted the stag. beaver. bea, fox, wolf and wild
boa. Remains of such domestic animals asthe ox, horse sheep,
goat, pig. dog, and as, show that they were a pastoral although
fot an agricultural people.

‘A new racial element. The use of polished stone weapons,
the manufacture of pottery’ the hut villages anda uniform system
of burial rites distinguished the Neolithic from the Paleolithic
civilization. And, because of these differences, especially
‘because ofthe introduction of this system of burial which argues
distinctive set of religious belies, in addition tothe fet that the
‘development of this civilization fom that which preceded cannot
be traced om Italian soil its held with reason tata the opening
ofthe Neolithic Age anew race entered Italy. bringing with it the
[Neolithic culture. Here and there men ofthe former age may have
survived and copied the ars ofthe newcomers, but throughout
the whole peninsula the racial unity ofthe population is shown
by the uniformity of their burial customs. ‘The inhabitants of
Sicily and Sardinia inthis age had a civilization ofthe same type
as that onthe mainland.

‘The Ligurians probably a Neolithic people. 1 is highly
probable that one of the historic peoples of Haly was a direct
‘Survival from the Neolithic period. This was the people called the
Ligures (Ligurians), who ta late date maintained themselves in
the mountainous district around the Gulf of Genoa. In support
of this view it may be urged (1) that tradition regarded them
as one of the oldest peoples of Haly (2) that even when Rome
‘was the dominant state in Italy they occupied the whole western
portion ofthe Po valley and extended southward almest to Psa,
‘while they were believed to have eld at onetime a much wider
territory. (3) that atthe opening of our wn era they were stil in
comparatively barbarous stat, living in eaves and rude buts,
and (4) thatthe Neolithic culture survived longest inthis region,
‘which was unaffected by the migrations of subsequent ages.

 10 A History of Rome to $65 A.D.

‘The Aencolithic Age. The introduction of the use of copper
marks the transition from the Neolithic period to that called the
Acneolithic. or Stone and Copper Age. This itself is bat a prelude
to the ue Bronze Age. Apparently copper fist found its way
into Italy along the trade routes fom the Danube valley and from
the easter Mediterranean, while the local deposits were as yet
lunworked, In other respects thee is no great difference between
the Neolithic civilization and the Aeneolithic, and there is no
evidence to place the entrance of a new race ito Kay at this

‘The Bronze Age. The Bronze Age proper in Italy is marked
by the appearance of a new ‘ype of civiliation—that of the
builders ofthe pile villages. There are two distinct forms of pile
village. ‘The one called palafine, is a wue lake village, raised
fon a pile structure above the waters of the surrounding lake ot
marsh. The otber, called terramaz, isa pile village constructed
‘on solid ground and surrounded by an atiticial most

‘The palfitte. The traces of the palate ae fairy closely
confined to the Alpine lake region of lal from Lake Maggiore
to Lake Garda. In general, these lake villages date from an
carly stage of Bronze Age culture, for later on, in most cases
their inhabitants seem to have abandoned them for sites on dry
land further to the south, The lake-dwellers were hunters and
herdsmen, bu they practised agriculture as well raising corn and
nile. In addition to their broaze implements, they continued to
tse those of more primitive materials—bone and stone. They.
too, manufactured a characteristic sort of potery, of rather rude
‘workmanship, which difers strikingly from that ofthe Neolithic
‘Age. Inthe late Bronze Age, at any rat, they eremated their dead
and buried the ashes in funerary urns. For their earlier practice
evidence is lacking.

‘The terramare, The terrumare settlements ate found chiefly
inthe Po valley; to the north of that river around Mantua, and
to the south between Piacenza and Bologna, Scattered villages

LIZATION IN ITALY 1

have been found throughout the peninsula: one as far south as
Taranto. The ferramare village was regularly constructed in the
form ofa trapezoid, with a north and south orientation. It was
surrounded by an earthen wall, around the base of which ean
wide moat, supplied with running water from a neighboring
stream. Access to the settlement was had by a single wooden
bridge, easy to destroy in time of danger. The space within the
wall was divided inthe center by a main road running nonh and
south the whole length ofthe settlement. It was paralleled by
some narrower roads and intersected at right angles by others
(On one side of this main highway was a space surrounded by
an inner moat, crossed by a bridge. This area was uninhabited
and probably devoted to religious purposes. The dwellings were
built on pile foundations along the roadways. Outside the most
‘was placed the cemetery. The dead were cremated and the ashes
deposited in ossuary urns, which were laid side by side in the
burial places. The remains were rarely accompanied by anything
but some smaller vases placed in the ossuay.

‘The terramare civilization. With the terramare people
bronze had almost completly supplanted stone instruments
Bronze daggers, swords, axes, arrowheads, spearheads, razors,
and pins have been preserved in abundance, However, aticles
fof hone and of hom were also in general use. The terramare
civilization had likewise its special type of hand-made pottery
fof peculiar shapes and ornamentation. A characteristic form of|
‘omamentation was the escent shaped handle (asa lunata) The
terramare peoples were both agricultural and pastoral, cultivating (11)
‘wheat and fla and raising the beter known domestic animals:
‘while they also hunted the stag and the wild boar.

‘The peoples of the palaftte and the terramare. Owing
to their custom of dwvelling in ple villages, their practice of
cremating their dead, and other characteristics peculiar to their
‘ype of civilization, the pooples ofthe palit and the terramare
are believed to have introduced a new racial clement into aly

the later probably came fom the valley ofthe Danube, These

tnd because ofthe striking similarity between the design of the
terramaresetlements and that of the Roman foiled camps, it
has been suggested that they were the forerunners ofthe Haan
peoples of histori times.

Other types of Bronze Age culture in Italy. The Neolithic
population of northern Italy developed a Bronze Age civilization

the lake-dwellrs. In the southem part ofthe peninsula and in
Sicily. however, the Bronze Age developed more independently.
although showing decided traces of influences from the eastern
“Mediterranean. Only in its later stages does it show the effect of
the southward migration ofthe builders ofthe pile villages.

‘The Iron Age. The prehistoric Iron Age in Haly has left
extensive remains in the northern and central regions, but such
is by no means the case in the south. The most important center
of this civilization was at Villanova, near Bologna. Here, again,
we have to do with a new type of civilization, which is not 3
development ofthe terramare culture, In addition tothe use of
iron, this age is marked by the practice of cremation, with the
employment of burial uns of a distinctive type, placed in well
tombs (iombe a pozzo). In Etruria, othe south ofthe Apennines
the Early Iron Age is of the Villanova type. It seems fairly
certain that both in Umbeia and in Etruria this civilization is the
‘work of the Umbrians, who at one time occupied the tritory
on bath sides of the Apennines. Regarding the migration of the
‘Umbrians into Italy we know nothing, bat it seems probable that
their civilization had its rise in central Europe, The later Iron
Age civilization both in Etruria and northward of the Apennines
has been identified as that ofthe truscans.
