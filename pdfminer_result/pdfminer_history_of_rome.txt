A HISTORY OF ROME TO 565
A. D.

CHAPTER I

THE GEOGRAPHY OF ITALY

Italy, ribbed by the Apennines, girdled by the Alps and the sea,
juts out like a “long pier-head” from Europe towards the northern
coast of Africa.
It includes two regions of widely differing
physical characteristics: the northern, continental; the southern,
peninsular. The peninsula is slightly larger than the continental
portion: together their area is about 91,200 square miles.

Continental Italy. The continental portion of Italy consists of
the southern watershed of the Alps and the northern watershed of
the Apennines, with the intervening lowland plain, drained, for
the most part, by the river Po and its numerous tributaries. On
the north, the Alps extend in an irregular crescent of over 1200
miles from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic. They rise abruptly
on the Italian side, but their northern slope is gradual, with easy
passes leading over the divide to the southern plain. Thus they
invite rather than deter immigration from central Europe. East
and west continental Italy measures around 320 miles; its width
from north to south does not exceed seventy miles.

The peninsula. The southern portion of Italy consists of a
long, narrow peninsula, running northwest and southeast between
the Mediterranean and Adriatic seas, and terminating in two
promontories, which form the toe and heel of the “Italian boot.”
The length of the peninsula is 650 miles; its breadth is nowhere

more than 125 miles. In striking contrast to the plains of the
Po, southern Italy is traversed throughout by the parallel ridges
of the Apennines, which give it an endless diversity of hill and
valley. The average height of these mountains, which form
a sort of vertebrate system for the peninsula (Apennino dorso
Italia dividitur, Livy xxxvi, 15), is about 4,000 feet, and even
their highest peaks (9,500 feet) are below the line of perpetual
snow. The Apennine chain is highest on its eastern side where
it approaches closely to the Adriatic, leaving only a narrow strip
of coast land, intersected by numerous short mountain torrents.
On the west the mountains are lower and recede further from
the sea, leaving the wide lowland areas of Etruria, Latium and
Campania. On this side, too, are rivers of considerable length,
navigable for small craft; the Volturnus and Liris, the Tiber and
the Arno, whose valleys link the coast with the highlands of the
interior.

The coast-line. In comparison with Greece, Italy presents a
striking regularity of coast-line. Throughout its length of over
2000 miles it has remarkably few deep bays or good harbors,
and these few are almost all on the southern and western shores.
Thus the character of the Mediterranean coast of Italy, with its
fertile lowlands, its rivers, its harbors, and its general southerly
aspect, rendered it more inviting and accessible to approach from
the sea than the eastern coast, and determined its leadership in
the cultural and material advancement of the peninsula.
Climate. The climate of Italy as a whole,

like that of
other Mediterranean lands, is characterized by a high average
temperature, and an absence of extremes of heat or cold.
Nevertheless, it varies greatly in different localities, according
to their northern or southern situation, their elevation, and their
proximity to the sea. In the Po valley there is a close approach
to the continental climate of central Europe, with a marked
difference between summer and winter temperatures and clearly
marked transitional periods of spring and autumn. On the other

hand, in the south of the peninsula the climate becomes more
tropical, with its periods of winter rain and summer drought, and
a rapid transition between the moist and the dry seasons.

Malaria. Both in antiquity and in modern times the disease
from which Italy has suffered most has been the dreaded malaria.
The explanation is to be found in the presence of extensive
marshy areas in the river valleys and along the coast. The
ravages of this disease have varied according as the progress
of civilization has brought about the cultivation and drainage of
the affected areas or its decline has wrought the undoing of this
beneficial work.
Forests.

In striking contrast to their present baldness, the
slopes of the Apennines were once heavily wooded, and the
well-tilled fields of the Po valley were also covered with tall
forests. Timber for houses and ships was to be had in abundance,
and as late as the time of Augustus Italy was held to be a
well-forested country.

Minerals. The mineral wealth of Italy has never been very
great at any time. In antiquity the most important deposits were
the iron ores of the island of Elba, and the copper mines of Etruria
and Liguria. For a time, the gold washings in the valleys of the
Graian Alps were worked with profit.

Agriculture. The true wealth of Italy lay in the richness of
her soil, which generously repaid the labor of agriculturist or
horticulturist. The lowland areas yielded large crops of grain of
all sorts—millet, maize, wheat, oats and barley—while legumes
were raised in abundance everywhere. Campania was especially
fertile and is reported to have yielded three successive crops
annually. The vine and the olive flourished, and their cultivation
eventually became even more profitable than the raising of grain.
The valleys and mountain sides afforded excellent pasturage
at all seasons, and the raising of cattle and sheep ranked
next in importance to agricultural pursuits among the country’s
industries.

A History of Rome to 565 A. D.

The islands: Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica. The geographical
location of the three large islands, Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica,
links their history closely with that of the Italian peninsula. The
large triangle of Sicily (11,290 sq. mi.) is separated from the
southwest extremity of Italy by the narrow straits of Rhegium,
and lies like a stepping-stone between Europe and Africa. Its
situation, and the richness of its soil, which caused it to become
one of the granaries of Rome, made it of far greater historical
importance than the other two islands. Sardinia (9,400 sq. mi.)
and Corsica (3,376 sq. mi.), owing to their rugged, mountainous
character and their greater remoteness from the coast of Italy,
have been always, from both the economic and the cultural
standpoint, far behind the more favored Sicily.

The historical significance of Italy’s configuration and
location. The configuration of the Italian peninsula,
long,
narrow, and traversed by mountain ridges, hindered rather than
helped its political unification. Yet the Apennine chain, running
parallel to the length of the peninsula, offered no such serious
barriers to that unification as did the network of mountains and
the long inlets that intersect the peninsula of Greece. And when
once Italy had been welded into a single state by the power of
Rome, its central position greatly facilitated the extension of the
Roman dominion over the whole Mediterranean basin.

The name Italia. The name Italy is the ancient Italia, derived
from the people known as the Itali, whose name had its origin
in the word vitulus (calf). It was applied by the Greeks as early
as the fifth century B. C. to the southwestern extremity of the
peninsula, adjacent to the island of Sicily. It rapidly acquired a
much wider significance, until, from the opening of the second
century, Italia in a geographical sense denoted the whole country
as far north as the Alps. Politically, as we shall see, the name for
a long time had a much more restricted significance.

PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION IN
ITALY

Accessibility of Italy to external influences. The long coast-
line of the Italian peninsula rendered it peculiarly accessible to
influences from overseas, for the sea united rather than divided
the peoples of antiquity. Thus Italy was constantly subjected
to immigration by sea, and much more so to cultural stimuli
from the lands whose shores bordered the same seas as her own.
Nor did the Alps and the forests and swamps of the Po valley
oppose any effectual barrier to migrations and cultural influences
from central Europe. Consequently we have in Italy the meeting
ground of peoples coming by sea from east and south and coming
over land from the north, each bringing a new racial, linguistic,
and cultural element to enrich the life of the peninsula. These
movements had been going on since remote antiquity, until, at the
beginning of the period of recorded history, Italy was occupied
by peoples of different races, speaking different languages, and
living under widely different political and cultural conditions.

As yet many problems connected with the origin and
migrations of the historic peoples of Italy remain unsolved;
but the sciences of archaeology and philology have done much
toward enabling us to present a reasonably clear and connected
picture of the development of civilization and the movements of
these peoples in prehistoric times.

The Old Stone Age. From all over Italy come proofs of the
presence of man in the earliest stage of human development—the
Paleolithic or Old Stone Age. The chipped flint instruments of

A History of Rome to 565 A. D.

this epoch have been found in considerable abundance, and are
chiefly of the Moustérien and Chelléen types. With these have
been unearthed the bones of the cave bear, cave lion, cave hyena,
giant stag, and early types of the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and
elephant, which Paleolithic man fought and hunted. In the Balzi
Rossi caves, near Ventimiglia in Liguria, there have been found
human skeletons, some of which, at least, are agreed to be of the
Paleolithic Age. But the caves in Liguria and elsewhere, then the
only habitations which men knew, do not reveal the lifelike and
vigorous mural drawings and carvings on bone, which the Old
Stone Age has left in the caves of France and Spain.

The New Stone Age. With the Neolithic or New Stone Age
there appears in Italy a civilization characterized by the use
of instruments of polished stone. Axes, adzes, and chisels, of
various shapes and sizes, as well as other utensils, were shaped by
polishing and grinding from sandstone, limestone, jade, nephrite,
diorite, and other stones. Along with these, however, articles of
chipped flint and obsidian, for which the workshops have been
found, and also instruments of bone, were in common use. The
Neolithic people were also acquainted with the art of making
pottery, an art unknown to the Paleolithic Age.

Like the men of the preceding epoch, those of the Neolithic
Age readily took up their abode in natural caves. However, they
also built for themselves villages of circular huts of wicker-work
and clay, at times erected over pits excavated in the ground.
Such village sites, the so-called fonde di capanne, are widely
distributed throughout Italy.

They buried their dead in caves, or in pits dug in the ground,
sometimes lining the pit with stones. The corpse was regularly
placed in a contracted position, accompanied by weapons, vases,
clothing, and food. Second burials and the practice of coloring
the bones of the skeletons with red pigment were in vogue.

Climatic change.

Italy had changed
considerably from that of the preceding age, and a new fauna had

appeared. In place of the primitive elephant and his associates,
Neolithic men hunted the stag, beaver, bear, fox, wolf and wild
boar. Remains of such domestic animals as the ox, horse, sheep,
goat, pig, dog, and ass, show that they were a pastoral although
not an agricultural people.

A new racial element. The use of polished stone weapons,
the manufacture of pottery, the hut villages and a uniform system
of burial rites distinguished the Neolithic from the Paleolithic
civilization. And, because of these differences, especially
because of the introduction of this system of burial which argues
a distinctive set of religious beliefs, in addition to the fact that the
development of this civilization from that which preceded cannot
be traced on Italian soil, it is held with reason that at the opening [9]
of the Neolithic Age a new race entered Italy, bringing with it the
Neolithic culture. Here and there men of the former age may have
survived and copied the arts of the newcomers, but throughout
the whole peninsula the racial unity of the population is shown
by the uniformity of their burial customs. The inhabitants of
Sicily and Sardinia in this age had a civilization of the same type
as that on the mainland.

The Ligurians probably a Neolithic people.

It is highly
probable that one of the historic peoples of Italy was a direct
survival from the Neolithic period. This was the people called the
Ligures (Ligurians), who to a late date maintained themselves in
the mountainous district around the Gulf of Genoa. In support
of this view it may be urged (1) that tradition regarded them
as one of the oldest peoples of Italy, (2) that even when Rome
was the dominant state in Italy they occupied the whole western
portion of the Po valley and extended southward almost to Pisa,
while they were believed to have held at one time a much wider
territory, (3) that at the opening of our own era they were still in
a comparatively barbarous state, living in caves and rude huts,
and (4) that the Neolithic culture survived longest in this region,
which was unaffected by the migrations of subsequent ages.

A History of Rome to 565 A. D.

The Aeneolithic Age. The introduction of the use of copper
marks the transition from the Neolithic period to that called the
Aeneolithic, or Stone and Copper Age. This itself is but a prelude
to the true Bronze Age. Apparently copper first found its way
into Italy along the trade routes from the Danube valley and from
the eastern Mediterranean, while the local deposits were as yet
unworked. In other respects there is no great difference between
the Neolithic civilization and the Aeneolithic, and there is no
evidence to place the entrance of a new race into Italy at this
time.

The Bronze Age. The Bronze Age proper in Italy is marked
by the appearance of a new type of civilization—that of the
builders of the pile villages. There are two distinct forms of pile
village. The one, called palafitte, is a true lake village, raised
on a pile structure above the waters of the surrounding lake or
marsh. The other, called terramare, is a pile village constructed
on solid ground and surrounded by an artificial moat.

The palafitte. The traces of the palafitte are fairly closely
confined to the Alpine lake region of Italy from Lake Maggiore
In general, these lake villages date from an
to Lake Garda.
early stage of Bronze Age culture, for later on, in most cases,
their inhabitants seem to have abandoned them for sites on dry
land further to the south. The lake-dwellers were hunters and
herdsmen, but they practised agriculture as well, raising corn and
millet. In addition to their bronze implements, they continued to
use those of more primitive materials—bone and stone. They,
too, manufactured a characteristic sort of pottery, of rather rude
workmanship, which differs strikingly from that of the Neolithic
Age. In the late Bronze Age, at any rate, they cremated their dead
and buried the ashes in funerary urns. For their earlier practice
evidence is lacking.

The terramare. The terramare settlements are found chiefly
in the Po valley; to the north of that river around Mantua, and
to the south between Piacenza and Bologna. Scattered villages

[10]


PREHISTORIC CIVILIZATION IN ITALY

11

have been found throughout the peninsula; one as far south as
Taranto. The terramare village was regularly constructed in the
form of a trapezoid, with a north and south orientation. It was
surrounded by an earthen wall, around the base of which ran
a wide moat, supplied with running water from a neighboring
stream. Access to the settlement was had by a single wooden
bridge, easy to destroy in time of danger. The space within the
wall was divided in the center by a main road running north and
south the whole length of the settlement. It was paralleled by
some narrower roads and intersected at right angles by others.
On one side of this main highway was a space surrounded by
an inner moat, crossed by a bridge. This area was uninhabited
and probably devoted to religious purposes. The dwellings were
built on pile foundations along the roadways. Outside the moat
was placed the cemetery. The dead were cremated and the ashes
deposited in ossuary urns, which were laid side by side in the
burial places. The remains were rarely accompanied by anything
but some smaller vases placed in the ossuary.

The terramare civilization. With the terramare people
bronze had almost completely supplanted stone instruments.
Bronze daggers, swords, axes, arrowheads, spearheads, razors,
and pins have been preserved in abundance. However, articles
of bone and of horn were also in general use. The terramare
civilization had likewise its special type of hand-made pottery
of peculiar shapes and ornamentation. A characteristic form of
ornamentation was the crescent-shaped handle (ansa lunata). The
terramare peoples were both agricultural and pastoral, cultivating [11]
wheat and flax and raising the better known domestic animals;
while they also hunted the stag and the wild boar.

The peoples of the palafitte and the terramare. Owing
to their custom of dwelling in pile villages, their practice of
cremating their dead, and other characteristics peculiar to their
type of civilization, the peoples of the palafitte and the terramare
are believed to have introduced a new racial element into Italy.


12

A History of Rome to 565 A. D.

The former probably descended from the Swiss lake region, while
the latter probably came from the valley of the Danube. These
peoples, abandoning the lakes and marshes of the Po valley,
spread southward over the peninsula. Because of this expansion
and because of the striking similarity between the design of the
terramare settlements and that of the Roman fortified camps, it
has been suggested that they were the forerunners of the Italian
peoples of historic times.

Other types of Bronze Age culture in Italy. The Neolithic
population of northern Italy developed a Bronze Age civilization
under the stimulus of contact with the terramare people and
the lake-dwellers. In the southern part of the peninsula and in
Sicily, however, the Bronze Age developed more independently,
although showing decided traces of influences from the eastern
Mediterranean. Only in its later stages does it show the effect of
the southward migration of the builders of the pile villages.

The Iron Age. The prehistoric Iron Age in Italy has left
extensive remains in the northern and central regions, but such
is by no means the case in the south. The most important center
of this civilization was at Villanova, near Bologna. Here, again,
we have to do with a new type of civilization, which is not a
development of the terramare culture. In addition to the use of
iron, this age is marked by the practice of cremation, with the
employment of burial urns of a distinctive type, placed in well
tombs (tombe a pozzo). In Etruria, to the south of the Apennines,
the Early Iron Age is of the Villanova type.
It seems fairly
certain that both in Umbria and in Etruria this civilization is the
work of the Umbrians, who at one time occupied the territory
on both sides of the Apennines. Regarding the migration of the
Umbrians into Italy we know nothing, but it seems probable that
their civilization had its rise in central Europe. The later Iron
Age civilization both in Etruria and northward of the Apennines
has been identified as that of the Etruscans.

Latium. In Latium the Iron Age civilization is a development

13

[12]

under Villanovan influences. Here a distinctive feature is the use
of a hut-shaped urn to receive the ashes of the dead. This urn
was itself deposited in a larger burial urn. This civilization is
that of the historic Latins, to whom belong also the hill villages
of Latium and the walled towns, constructed between the eighth
and the sixth centuries B. C.

Elsewhere in the northern part of Italy in the Iron Age we
have to do with a culture developing out of that of the terramare
period. Likewise in the east and south of the peninsula the Iron
Age is a local development under outside stimulus.

The preceding sketch of the rise of civilization in Italy has
brought us down to the point where we have to do with the
peoples who occupied Italian soil at the beginning of the historic
period, for from the sixth century it is possible to attempt a
connected historical record of the movements of these Italian
races.
