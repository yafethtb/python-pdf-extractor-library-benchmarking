THE GEOGRAPHY OF ITALY

tly, ribbed by the Apennines, girdled by the Alps and th sea,
juts out ikea �long piet-head� fom Europe towards the northern
coast of Africa. It includes two regions of widely differing
physical characteristics: dhe norther, continental: the southern,
peninsulat. The peninsula is slightly larger than the continental
portion: together their reais about 91,200 square miles.

�Continental Italy. The continental portion of Kaly consist of
the southem watershed ofthe Alps and the northem watershed of|
the Apennines, with the intervening lowland plain, drained, for
the most part, by the river Po and sts numerous tributaries. On
the north, the Alps extend in an irregular crescent of over 1200
mils rom the Mediterranean to the Adriatic They rise abruptly
�on the Italian side, but their north slope is gradual, with easy
passes leading over the divide to the southern plain. �Thus they
invite rather than deter immigration from central Europe. East
and west continental Italy measures around 320 miles; its width
from north o south does not exceed seventy miles

�The peninsula, �The southern portion of Kly consists of a
Jong. narrow peninsula. running northwest and southeastbetween
the Mediterranean and Adriatic sets, and terminating in two
romontories, which form the toe ad el of the �Italian boot

�more than 125 miles. In striking contrast to the plains of the
Po, southern Italy i traversed throughout by the parallel ridges
of the Apennines, which give it an endless diversity of bill and
valley. The average height of these mountains, which form
a sort of vertebrate system for the peninsula (Apennino dorso
alia dividinur, Livy xxx, 15), is about 4,000 feet, and even
their highest peaks (9,500 feet) are below the line of perpetual
snow. The Apennine chain is highest on its eastern side where
it approaches closely tothe Adriatic, leaving only a narrow strip
of coast land, intersected by numerous short mountain torrents
On the west the mountains are lower and recede further from
the sea, leaving the wide lowland areas of Etruria, Latium and
Campania. On this sie, too, are rivers of considerable length,
navigable for small raf: the Volturnus and Lris, the Tiber and
the Amo, whose valleys link the coast with the highlands of the

�The coastline, In comparison with Gresce, Italy presents &
striking regularity of coas-line. Throughout its length of over
2000 miles it has remarkably few deep bays or good harbors
land these few are almost all onthe southern and western shores
Thus the characte ofthe Mediterranean cost of Italy, with its
ferile lowlands, its rivers, its harbors, and its general southerly
aspect, rendered it more inviting and accesible o approach from
the sea than the eastern coast, and determined its leadership in
the cultural and material advancement of the peninsula
Climate. The climate of aly as a whole, like that of
other Mediterranean lands, is characterized by high average
temperature, and an absence of extremes of heat or cold
Nevertheless, it varies greatly in different localities, acconding
to their northern or southern situation, their elevation, and their
proximity to the sea. In the Po valley there is a close approach
to the continental climate of central Europe, with a marked
difference between summer and winter temperatures and clearly
�marked transitional periods of spring and attumn. On the other

hand, in the south of the peninsula the climate becomes more
tropical, with its periods of winter rain and summer drought, and
rapid transition between the moist and the dry seasons.

�Malaria. Hoth in antiquity and in modern times the disease
from which Kaly has suffered most hasbeen the dreaded malaria
The explanation i to be found in the presence of extensive
�marshy areas in the river valleys and along the coast. The
ravages of this disease have varied according as the progress
of civilization has brought about the cultivation and drainage of
the affected areas or its decline has wrought the undoing of this
beneficial work.

Forests, In st

ing contrast to their present baldness, the
slopes of the Apennines were once heavily wooded, and the
welll fields of the Po valley were also covered with tll
forests. Timber for houses and ships was to be had in abundance,
and as late as the time of Augustus laly was held 10 be a
well-frested country.

�Minerals. �The mineral wealth of Italy has never been very
reat at anytime. In antiquity the most important deposi were
the iron ores ofthe islandof Elba, and the copper mines of Etruria
and Liguria, Fora time, the gold washings in the valleys of the
Graian Alps were worked with profit

Agriculture. �The true wealth of Italy lay i the richness of
her soil, which generously repaid the lor of agriculturist or
hontculturst. The lowland areas yielded large erops of grain of
all sorts�millet, maize, whet, oats and barley�whle legumes
�were raised in abundance everywhere. Campania was especially
fertile and is reported to have yielded three successive crops
annually. The vine andthe olive Nourished, and ther cultivation
eventually became even moce profitable than the rising of grain

The valleys and mountain sides afforded excellent pastrage
at all seasons, and the raising of cattle and sheep ranked
next in importance to agricultural pursuits among the country�s
industries.

�The islands: Sicily, Sardinia, Corsica. The geographical
location of the three arg islands, Sicily. Sardinia and Corsica,

inks their history closely with tha of the Halian peninsula, The
large triangle of Sicily (11,290 sq. mi.) is separated from the
southwest extremity of Italy by the narrow straits of Rhegium,
tnd lies like a stepping-stone between Europe and Africa. ts
situation, and the richness ofits soil, which caused itt become
lone of the granaries of Rome, made it of far greater historical
importance than the other two islands. Sardinia (9,400 sq. mi.)
and Corsica (3,376 sq. mi) owing to their rugged, mountainous
character and their greater remoteness from the coast of Hay.
have been always, from both the economic and the cultural
standpoint, far behind the more favored Sicily.

�The historical significance of Italy's configuration and
location. The configuration of the Halian peninsula, long,
narrow and traversed by mountain ridges, hindered rather than
helped its political unification. Yet the Apeanine chin, running
parallel to the length of the peninsula, offered no such serious
barriers to that unification as did the network of mountains and
the long inlets that intersect the peninsula of Greece. And when
once Italy had been welded into a single state by the power of
Rome, its central position greatly facilitated the extension of the
Roman dominion over the whole Mediterranean basi,

�The name Italia. The name lta is the ancient aia derived
from the people known as the Fal, whose name had its origin
inthe word viulus (calf). It was applied by the Greeks as early
25 the fiflh century 8. to the southvesten extremity of the
Peninsula, adjacent to the island of Sicily. It rapidly acquired a
�much wider significance, uni fom the opening ofthe second
century alia ina geographical sense denoted the whole country
3s far nonh as the Alps. Politically as we shal see, the name for
�long time had a much more restricted significance.
